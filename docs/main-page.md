## RA or TA Assistantship

Please scroll away if you are not a poor CS graduate. Here are several ways you could try to get some assistantship:

RA:
- CS department faculty
- National Center for Supercomputing Applications
- Other departments at UIUC (hopefully it's really CS's era and everyone needs a computer student to make slides for them)

TA:
- The form you got from CS department
- Or you could try contact CS professors you know (Maybe having a grade of B- or up is a bonus)
- [Assistantship Clearinghouse](https://grad.illinois.edu/clearinghouse/)

## What UIUC CS doesn't do good

- Rare heavy industry-based courses
- Rare development courses (No matter web or mobile)
- Surprising ratio of enrolled students and course seats offered
